This folder contains implementations and re-implementations of some image restoration algorithms using mainly the
popular Alternating Direction Methods of Multipliers (ADMM).

Some of the codes included are:

1. Split Bregman Total Variation Denoising/Deblurring of Image
2. ALM/ADMM Total Variation Denoising/Deblurring of Image
3. Non-convex Lp-norm (0 < p <1) Total Variation Deblurring using ADMM/ALM and IRL1 (Iterative Reweighted L1).
4. Second Order ALM/ADMM Total Variation Denoising/Deblurring (TV image restoration using the 2nd Order Derivative operator). 
5. Robust Principal Componant Analysis (RPCA) for sparse noise restoration (impulse noise).
6. The state-of-the-art L0-TV by Yuan and Ghanem for impulse noise restoration (using pure ADMM).
